My Portfolio with Matrix Effect
Welcome to my personal portfolio website, featuring a Matrix-style background effect with cascading green characters, just like the iconic "Matrix" movie. This app is built using React and includes several pages to showcase my biography, interests, resume, portfolio, gallery, and contact form.
### Tech
### Features
Matrix Background Effect: A dynamic background that simulates the falling code from the Matrix movie using HTML5 <canvas>.
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using CSS.
Monospace Font: The entire website uses a monospace font to match the Matrix theme.
Multiple Pages: Includes various sections such as:
Home
Biography
Interests
Resume
Portfolio
Gallery
Contact
### Technologies Used
React: The app is built using React to manage the UI components.
CSS3: Custom styles for layout, responsiveness, and animations.
Canvas API: Used to create the Matrix-style falling numbers effect.
React Router: To handle page navigation between different sections of the portfolio.
JavaScript (ES6+): For all dynamic features, including the Matrix animation.

Design and Development
This project was developed as a personal portfolio with a Matrix-inspired theme to showcase my skills, interests, and projects. The design aims to reflect a modern, tech-savvy aesthetic thatâ€™s clean, simple, and user-friendly.

The Matrix background effect was implemented using the HTML5 Canvas API with JavaScript to simulate the falling green characters. The entire app is built with React to demonstrate modern frontend web development practices, including component-based architecture and dynamic rendering.
